// Prompt: List 200 of Sun Tzu's most famous quotes, except change them to express the same sentiment about Information Technology, Programming (especially the Design aspect of Development), and closely related topics.  Prefer artistic phrasing strongly reminiscent of Sun Tzu, without being too abstract.  Prefer replacing short words or phrases while maintaining the overall quote structure.  For each of the quotes, list 5 variants with these modifications.
